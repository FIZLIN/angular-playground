# Tasks

1. Fix issue with multiple dialogs being opened while navigating between user list <-> user edit
2. Create user entity form inside EntityComponent and use existing logic to "save" the updates and return back to user list if save was successful. Upon clicking a cancel button just return back to the user list.
3. Prevent unnecessary user fetch calls when opening the user entity dialog.
